## MPI (Message Passing Interface)

### What is MPI?

MPI also known as message passing interface is a set of standards that define a way to exchange data between processes. Most CPU parallel programming languages use MPI for communication.

### What MPI implementations are available on Sharanga?

Currently, we support the following MPI implementations:

- [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)
- [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/)
- [MVAPICH2](https://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/)

Type the following command in the terminal to view the list of available MPI modules:

```bash
$ spack find mpi
```

We request the users to use these modules as they are optimised to run on Sharanga. To compile a MPI based CPU parallel job on Sharanga, use any of the following MPI commands. We have also provided an equivalent GNU Compiler command for the same.

| MPI Compiler Collection | GNU Compiler Collection |
| :---------------------: | :---------------------: |
|          mpicc          |           gcc           |
|     mpic++, mpicxx      |           g++           |
|         mpifort         |        gfortran         |

For example to compile a C++ MPI application `sample.cxx` using MPI C++ compiler `mpic++`:

```bash
$ mpic++ sample.cxx
```
